# Bullet-Hell-Game-Jam-2021

Game Jam on Itch.io.
The task was to create a bullet hell game with the theme being 10 seconds.
So our game changes level every 10 seconds with a shockwave effect. The win state is killing all enemies on all levels including the boss on level 4.

- Development of level transition system.
- UI:
  - Start screen
  - Death screen
  - Health bar
